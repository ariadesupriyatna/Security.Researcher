# Programming Language
A programming language is an artificial language which is used to design instructions that are executed by a particular machine (computer) for performing some tasks (computation, evaluation, etc.).

## POP (Procedure-Oriented Programming Language)
Procedure-oriented programming (POP) language is a programming language in which a list of instructions is given to the computer to follow, in order to perform a task. These instructions are organized into groups which are known as functions (procedures).  
BASIC, BCPL, C, COBOL, etc., all are Procedure-oriented programming languages.

## OOP (Object-Oriented Programming Language)
Object-Oriented programming (OOP) language is based on objects, instead of just functions and procedures. These objects are organized into classes, which allow individual objects to be grouped together.  
C++, C#, Java, Eiffel, etc., all are Object-oriented programming languages.

## Source Code
Source code is a code which is written by the programmer in human-readable form with proper programming syntaxes.

## Executable Code
Executable code is the machine-understandable code, which can be executed by a machine (OS).

## Compiler
Compiler is a software module that translates (converts) the source code of a program into executable code.

## Header File
A header file is a file that contains the declaration of library functions, global variables (defined in other source files), and macro definitions. The extension of the header file is `.h`.

## Tokens
The smallest individual units in a program are known as Tokens. They are basically individual words, symbols, and punctuation marks.

## Constants
Constants are fixed values that do not change during the execution of a program.

## Variables
A variable is a memory location in the program's memory that is used to store a data value or information. The value stored in a variable can be modified during the program's execution.

## Identifier
An identifier is a tag name for a particular entity (e.g., variable, function, etc.), which uniquely identifies it.

## Datatype
A datatype provides information about type definitions (i.e., the type of data that is to be stored in a variable).

## Keywords
Keywords are reserved words whose meanings are already known to the compiler.

## Operators
Operators are symbols that perform predefined operations on operands.

## Expression
A statement having a valid sequence of operators and operands is known as an expression.

## Type-Casting
Type-casting is a way of converting a variable from one data type (e.g., `int`) to another data type (e.g., `float`).

## Control Statements
Control or decision-making statements are the statements in a program that control the execution order of the statements, i.e., the order in which instructions in a program must be executed.

## Pointer
A pointer is a special type of variable that can store the address of another variable.

## Function
A function is a group of statements (instructions) that perform a predefined task.

## Recursion
When a function calls itself, it is known as recursion.

## Array
An array is a collection of variables having the same data type.

## Structure
A structure is a collection of variables having different data types under a single name tag.

## Union
A union is a derived datatype that allows storing different types of data (values having different datatypes) in the same memory location, one at a time.

## Class
A class is a blueprint from which objects are created. A class contains data members to store information and member functions to operate upon data members.

## Object
An object is an instance of a class. It is basically a real-world implementation of the class, having all the property values defined or structured in the class.

## Data Member
Data variables of a class are known as the data members of the class.

## Member Function
Functions belonging to a particular class are known as member functions of that class.

## Constructor
A constructor is a special member function having the same name as the class name and is used for the automatic initialization of objects of the class. It gets automatically called whenever an object of its class is created.

## Destructor
A destructor is a special member function having the same name as the class name, preceded by a tilde (`~`), and is used to destroy the objects created by the constructor.

## Inheritance
When a class inherits or acquires the property of another class, this is known as inheritance.

### Base Class
A base class is a class whose properties are inherited by another class.

### Derived Class
A derived class is a class that inherits the properties of the base class.

### Single Inheritance
Single inheritance involves one base class and one derived class.

### Hierarchical Inheritance
Hierarchical inheritance involves one base class and two or more derived classes.

### Multiple Inheritance
Multiple inheritance involves one derived class and two or more base classes.

### Multilevel Inheritance
Multilevel inheritance involves one base class (A), one derived class (B) which in turn serves as a base class for one more derived (C) class.

### Hybrid Inheritance
Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more inheritance types.

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism means "One name, many forms". One entity behaves differently in different situations.

### Function Overloading
Function overloading refers to functions with the same name having different numbers of arguments.

### Function Overriding
Function overriding refers to functions with the same name having the same number of arguments.

## `this` Pointer
The `this` pointer is an object pointer that points to the currently calling object.

## Friend Function
A friend function is a function that allows access to the private members of a class.

## Abstract Class
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated.

## Operator Overloading
Operator overloading is a way of providing new definitions for C++ operators.

## Exception
Runtime errors are known as exceptions.

## Exception Handling
Exception handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors (exceptions).

## File Handling
File handling is a way of dealing with the data on secondary storage devices (such as a hard disk) from a program. File handling operations include opening a file, reading a file, writing a file, closing a file, etc.
